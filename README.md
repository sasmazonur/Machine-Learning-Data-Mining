## Class Description
This course will provide a basic introduction to this dynamic and fast advancing field. \
Topics include the three basic branches in this field: 
* (1) Supervised learning for prediction problems (learn to predict)
* (2) Unsupervised learning for clustering data and discovering interesting patterns from data (learn to understand)
* (3) Reinforcement learning for learning to select actions based on positive and negative feedback (learn to act)

Students will not only learn various machine learning and data mining techniques, but also learn how to apply them to real problems in practice.

## Learning objectives: 
Upon completing the course, students are expected to be able to:
* 1) Students are able to apply supervised learning algorithms to prediction problems and evaluate the results.
* 2) Students are able to apply unsupervised learning algorithms to data analysis problems and evaluate results.
* 3) Students are able to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to control problem and evaluate results.
* 4) Students are able to take a description of a new problem and decide what kind of problem (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement) it is.
